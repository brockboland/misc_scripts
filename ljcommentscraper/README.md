Back in the day, I had a Movable Type blog (which was then migrated to WordPress, and then to Drupal, and now to [Octopress](http://brockboland.com/)) that was also syndicated on LiveJournal.com. People often live comments on LiveJournal, but since comments were enabled on the blog itself, this segmented conversation a bit.

I wrote this script to scrape the syndicated account on LiveJournal to grab comments left there, and import them as comments in MovableType or WordPress. Honestly, I can't remember how it works; read through the comments if you're interested.

There are two versions: one for MovableType (ljcommentgrabber-mt.php) and one for WordPress (ljcommentgrabber-wp.php). I'm sure they won't work with modern versions of either system.
